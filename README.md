# CozmoValet
COSC 6397 Final Project

This proejct investigates the performance of a pair of Cozmo robots performing a loading task from a raised platform. It uses a homogeneous  strategy where the two robots independently move cubes from the platform to storage areas. In contrast, the robots also use a heterogeneous strategy, with one moving the cubes to the edge of the platform and the other moving the cubes to their final destinations.
